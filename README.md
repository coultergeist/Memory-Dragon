Description:

This game is a simple memory game with vivid colors and addicting gameplay. The user has to select the colored dots in the order that they appear on the screen within a given time limit. The game starts out with just one dot appearing, but the number of dots quickly rises as the user successfully select the dots in the correct order. Points are giving for correctly identifying a set of dots and the user will move up a level once they reach a 10 dot combo! All of this with the addition of the increasing speed of which the dots appear will make gameplay both quick and challenging.

On the rainbow painted streets of Dotville, the angry homophobic dragon “Trump Firebreather” has captured the beautiful Drag Queen Princess, 1010. The only way to free 1010 is to memorize the code while the dragon is getting his hair plug "replugged." Memorize the combos of colors as they appear and tap where the dots where when you last saw them to begin hacking the lock. The lock is a 10 phase lock. At first you'll only have to memorize short combos but as you get closer to breaking the lock the combos will become longer. Reach level 10 and free 1010. Hurry! Time is running out!

Oh no! “Trump Firebreather” has finally replugged his plugs and has discovered you trying to save the princess! He takes in a deep breath and as he releases his flames, you hear the words, “You’re fired.” Try again after he leaves!

Woah!!! You did it. 1010 is free!

Congratulations! You have saved 1010 with your amazing memorization skills. "Trump Firebreather" is defeated and lost all of his sponsors. The kingdom of magical unicorns of Dotsville will forever hail you as their hero. 1010 would like to reward your diligence with a key to Dotsville City.

Bonus Round:

Oh no! It looks as though "Trump Firebreather" is gaining power again, and is slowly attacking in a nearby town, Lineslane City where "Bernie Rainbows," the retired Mayor of Dotsville City currently is visiting to ensure that the rich don't gain too much power in their crumbling infrastructure. (In his retirement, "Bernie Rainbows" has frequently helped crumbling neighbor cities get back on their feet.) "Trump Firebreather" is holding "Bernie Rainbows" hostage, and won't let him return to Dotsville until you go defeat him in Lineslane City.

In this bonus round, you and Lineslane are coming together to defeat "Bernie Rainbows." Connect same-color dots to form a line before time runs out.

Congratulations! You have defeated "Trump Firebreather" once more and have saved "Bernie Rainbows." Dotsville is absorbing Lineslane until it gets back on its feet, because "Bernie Rainbows" is now making sure "Trump Firebreather" is getting taxed!
